I’m a software engineer from Zagreb, Croatia. I’m currently working as an iOS engineer at [FIVE](http://five.agency/).

My topics of interest vary from mobile development to [computer graphics](https://github.com/srdanrasic/R4) and computer vision. I like reading about [psychology](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555), [machine intelligence](http://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0199678111) and [space missions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons).

On this site I’ll try to write about challenges I’m encountering and solutions I’ve come up with or learned about in my professional and personal career as a software engineer.

You can find more info about me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=85066651) and [GitHub](https://github.com/srdanrasic), follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/srdanrasic) or ping me at <srdan.rasic@gmail.com>.
